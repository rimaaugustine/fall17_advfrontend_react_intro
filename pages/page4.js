    <h1>My fourth page!</h1>
    <div>
      This is our fourth page. Here we are showing how annotate an element with
      a CSS class name. Note that unlike standard HTML, JSX requires you to use
      the "className" attribute (instead of the usual "class" attribute).
    </div>
    <div>
      In order for the "className" attribute to have any effect, it has to
      correspond to a CSS rule found somewhere. We added a "static/main.css"
      containing a single "yellow" rule, which assigns a yellow background
      color. Next.js will serve any file that is placed inside the "static/"
      folder as a static file, so that's the place to put your CSS, images,
      fonts and favicons.
    </div>
    <div className="yellow">This is a paragraph with yellow background.</div>
  </div>
